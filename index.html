        <h2>Excerpt</h2>
        <p>
            In <em>Kindred</em>, something that added a twist to the story was the ending when Dana tries to kill Rufus after he tries to replace Alice in his heart with Dana. When Dana thinks about it at first she thinks it is fine and maybe it would be good but then she realizes that she doesn’t want to be Rufus’s lover so she stabs him twice. Dana is trying to travel back home but Rufus is grabbing onto her arm and won’t let go so when Dana gets home she realizes that she can’t move, she’s just stuck and she looks at her arm where Rufus was grabbing and her arm was part of the wall she tried to yank her arm out but she couldn’t. Dana is now part of the wall.

        <h2>Symbols</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Whips</b> <br>
            In <em>Kindred</em>, whips symbolize the white man’s capacity for violence and oppression. In the novel, the men who wield whips are to be feared; they use violence to get what they want. The whips symbolize the evil of racism and slavery. <br>
            <br>

            <b>Birthdays</b> <br>
            In <em>Kindred</em>, birthdays symbolize the cruel cycle of slavery. For the slaves on the plantation, though the birth of a child brings great joy, it also brings the suffering of being more reliant on staying at the plantation. It also brings the fear that the child will become a slave and may be sold away. <br>
            <br>

            <b>Maps</b> <br>
            In <em>Kindred</em>, maps symbolize the possibility of freedom. Because of this, it is extremely dangerous to own a map. A person with a map can find their way, while a person without one can only go as far as their own personal experience and memory allows.        </p>

        <h2>Theme</h2>
        <p>
            <b>The Corrupting Influence of Power</b> <br>
            Rufus, a child burdened with societal expectations, embodies the corrupting influence of power. While initially driven by compassion and respect for his friends Alice and Nigel, despite their different backgrounds, the inheritance thrusts him into a position of dominance. This newfound authority unleashes a latent arrogance within him, transforming him into a "small tyrant" who abuses his friends and elders. His transformation mirrors that of his father, Tom Weylin, who descends from a "routinely brutal" master into a capricious despot, driven by the insatiable appetite for more control.

        <h2>Literary Elements</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Foreshadowing</b> <br>
            <b>Excerpt</b>: Dana's first time traveling triggers a feeling of impending danger: "There was a sense of foreboding, even before I saw the smoke. It hung as a premonition in the air so thick it seemed I could taste it." <br>
            <br>
            <b>Meaning</b>: This foreshadows the violence and brutality Dana will encounter in the antebellum South. It establishes a sense of unease and suspense, propelling the reader forward. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Hero's Journey</b>: This aligns with the "Call to Adventure" stage, where the hero encounters a challenge that disrupts their ordinary life.

            <br>
            <br>

            <b>Diction and Syntax</b> <br>
            <b>Excerpt</b>: "He stood, staring at me, his jaw slack, eyes glazed. Then, as though a string had been cut, he crumpled, whimpering. He cradled his bloody head in his arms and rocked slowly back and forth."
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Meaning</b>: The fragmented syntax and vivid imagery evoke the shock and pain of witnessing brutality. It creates a sense of immediacy and emotional impact for the reader.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Hero's Journey</b>: This echoes the "Approach" stage, where the hero must confront their deepest fears and prepare for the final ordeal. The diction and syntax heighten the tension and underscore the stakes of Dana's journey.

        <h2>Connections</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Text-Text</b> <br> A movie by the name of Django Unchained takes us back into a time of slavery and follows a slave by the name of Django somewhere down the line of the story Django is freed from slavery and is set off to follow a white man on a journey. In this journey, Django is considered a free man. With the white man entering a plantation like our Novel Kindred, Dana is a free woman who happens to travel to a plantation, and initially, upon entering, they are treated with the disrespect of a colored person in that period. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Text-Self</b> <br> In the book Kindred the main character Dana starts to feel dizzy whenever she is about to time travel her husband knows this and without any knowledge of what he’s about to get himself into grabs ahold of Dana to travel with her to keep her safe. I can relate to this on a personal level because like her husband Kevin whenever someone I care for is in trouble I don't think about my safety and whatever I can do to make them feel safe. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Text-World</b> <br> In the Novel, Dana faces a lot of racism when she travels, she has to deal with discrimination and hurtful words being said to her and while it's not as extreme in today's society is still very real. Even if not as apparent on a day-to-day basis different races face racism and discrimination whether it’s at a job interview or a restaurant racism and discrimination is still prominent issue in today's world.

        <h2>Quotes</h2>
        <p>
            <b>“Tom Weylin wasn't a monster at all. Just an ordinary man who sometimes did monstrous things that society says is legal and proper” (134)</b> <br>
            This quote is coming directly from Dana and it shows me that even through all the terrible things she has seen from Tom she doesn't believe he’s a bad person but rather a person who is living a life that is “normal” to them and it shows a true understanding and development as a person to know that and not hate a person who is negative towards them.  
            <br> <br>
            <b>“I wonder how people just out of prison readjust?” (197)</b> <br>
            For me, this Direct quote shows negative growth in an important character due to his surroundings. First Kevin has spent too much time in the slave era that he forgot how to live life in his time. This is a very negative growth because as Dansas husband he is coming from a time of little slavery in his life to a time with major slavery as he begins to stay there for a long time, he begins succumbing to the ways of living life as a white man in the slave era and the end, he will eventually have to go back to his time. 
            <br> <br>
            <b>“I was prepared to wait that long myself before I tried something dangerous to get home” (236)</b> <br>
            This quote tells me two things. 1. Dana feels like she has some unfinished business in the slave era, which for her is making sure one of her friends that she made in her time staying on the plantation can make it to a better life. This shows that even with her life on the line she is willing to put others first. Second It shows me that her time here has been so terrible that she is willing to do something dangerous to herself to leave which means that she is completely done here and wants nothing more than to leave.

        <h2>Characterization</h2>
        <p>
            In our Novel <em>Kindred</em>, We have our protagonist: Dana, and one of our antagonists: Rufus. At the very start of our novel, we follow Dana into a dizzy portal that takes her to Rufus who Dana notices is currently in danger and without knowing where she is doesn't hesitate to save him, Dana is then greeted in an extremely rude way by Rufus family and later realizes she is in the slave era. It is here where Dana shows her insanely strong spirit and character to push through her time here and continuously save Rufus time and time again. Throughout her time here she faces several hardships like being separated from her husband and being whipped on some occasions but through it all Rufus is by her side helping her try to get through the time here in a semi-safe manner but it's not toward the end where we see that Rufus really has adapted to his surrounding nature and begins to become a threat to Dana and it is here where we see Dana has to accept that someone she has saved on countless occasions and has looked at as a friend no longer has her best interest at heart. This correlates to the hero's journey because throughout the novel she faces many hardships and in the end, she comes out semi-successful by escaping Rufus and the slave era and getting back to her time
